                    the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people 
                    who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found 
                    it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks
                    was the best-and most grueling-time of my life.
                    Since completing the course. I've successfully switched careers, working as a

                <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never 
                    written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals
                    who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of 
                    theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                    The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
                    They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
                    The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.
                    It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have .
                    In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my 
                    development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
                    after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "
